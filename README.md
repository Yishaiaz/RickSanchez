# Featured content
This website styling is done primarly using the CSS file.
The code given as an example generated an uncaught error (jquery script wasn't loaded anywhere in the code), i fixed it by importing jquery and removing a syntax error (that generated another issue.).
one nice css styling usage is at the photos section, creating a table and forcing the images and the cells to fit perfectly.
usage of fonts in the css.
added a footer tag, article, mark, navbar new to html5.
fixed issue with floating menu with nav tag and css attributes.
the qr code is configured to redirect to this website's address (hosted on github)
the like button is linked to the Facebook fan page of Rick&Morty tv series @ https://www.facebook.com/RickandMorty/
