This website styling is done via the CSS file.
The code given as an example generated an uncaught error (jquery script wasn't loaded anywhere in the code), i fixed it by import jquery and removing a syntax error (that generated another issue.).
one nice css styling usage is at the photos section, creating a table and forcing the images and the cells to fit perfectly.
usage of fonts in the css.
added a footer tag, new to html5
the like button and the qr code are configured to this website's address (hosted on github)
